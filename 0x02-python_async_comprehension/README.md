# Python Async Comprehension

Python Async Comprehension is a powerful feature introduced in Python 3.6 that allows you to write concise and efficient asynchronous code using comprehensions.

With async comprehensions, you can easily iterate over asynchronous sequences, such as async generators or async iterators, and collect the results in a compact and readable manner.

To use async comprehensions, you simply add the `async` keyword before the `for` keyword in a comprehension. This allows you to await asynchronous operations within the comprehension, making it ideal for working with asynchronous data sources.

Here's an example of how async comprehensions can be used to fetch data from multiple URLs concurrently:

```python
import aiohttp
import asyncio

async def fetch_data(url):
	async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
		async with session.get(url) as response:
			return await response.json()

async def fetch_multiple_data(urls):
	return [await fetch_data(url) async for url in urls]

async def main():
	urls = [
		'https://api.example.com/data1',
		'https://api.example.com/data2',
		'https://api.example.com/data3'
	]
	results = await fetch_multiple_data(urls)
	print(results)

asyncio.run(main())
```

In this example, we define an `async` function `fetch_data` that fetches data from a given URL using the `aiohttp` library. We then define another `async` function `fetch_multiple_data` that uses an async comprehension to fetch data from multiple URLs concurrently.

By using async comprehensions, we can fetch data from multiple URLs in parallel, improving the performance of our code.

Python Async Comprehension is a powerful tool that can greatly simplify and optimize your asynchronous code. It allows you to write concise and efficient code while taking advantage of the benefits of asynchronous programming.
